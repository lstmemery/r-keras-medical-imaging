	abstract = {There is recent popularity in applying machine learning to medical imaging, notably deep learning, which has achieved state-of-the-art performance in image analysis and processing. The rapid adoption of deep learning may be attributed to the availability of machine learning frameworks and libraries to simplify their use. In this tutorial, we provide a high-level overview of how to build a deep neural network for medical image classification, and provide code that can help those new to the field begin their informatics projects.},

	abstract = {Summary Deep Learning with R introduces the world of deep learning using the powerful Keras library and its R language interface. The book builds your understanding of deep learning through intuitive explanations and practical examples.  Continue your journey into the world of deep learning with Deep Learning with R in Motion, a practical, hands-on video course available exclusively at Manning.com (www.manning.com/livevideo/deep-​learning-with-r-in-motion). Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the Technology Machine learning has made remarkable progress in recent years. Deep-learning systems now enable previously impossible smart applications, revolutionizing image recognition and natural-language processing, and identifying complex patterns in data. The Keras deep-learning library provides data scientists and developers working in R a state-of-the-art toolset for tackling deep-learning tasks. About the Book Deep Learning with R introduces the world of deep learning using the powerful Keras library and its R language interface. Initially written for Python as Deep Learning with Python by Keras creator and Google AI researcher François Chollet and adapted for R by RStudio founder J. J. Allaire, this book builds your understanding of deep learning through intuitive explanations and practical examples. You'll practice your new skills with R-based applications in computer vision, natural-language processing, and generative models. What's Inside Deep learning from first principlesSetting up your own deep-learning environmentImage classification and generationDeep learning for text and sequences About the Reader You'll need intermediate R programming skills. No previous experience with machine learning or deep learning is assumed. About the Authors François Chollet is a deep-learning researcher at Google and the author of the Keras library. J.J. Allaire is the founder of RStudio and the author of the R interfaces to TensorFlow and Keras.
